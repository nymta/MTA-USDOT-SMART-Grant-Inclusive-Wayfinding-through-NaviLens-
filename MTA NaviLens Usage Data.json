Scan records include the code identifier, the type of asset scanned (e.g., bus stop, bus vehicle, subway station, train car, or vehicle feature), the app used (NaviLens vs. NaviLens GO), the device language setting at time of scan, and timestamps. For certain asset types, scan events are also enriched with location fields such as bus stop identifiers and names or subway station identifiers and names. This data supports evaluation of the NaviLens deployment and related project reporting, including work funded through the USDOT SMART Grant.",
